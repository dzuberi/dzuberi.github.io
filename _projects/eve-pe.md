Created a Processing Element and interconnect for a genetic algorithm hardware accelerator utilizing verilog (based off the [GeneSys paper](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/c/332/files/2018/09/genesys_micro2018.pdf)), ran synthesis for area/power/timing and used testbench to debug/verify.

This was my final project in Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning. There is an associated project report.
