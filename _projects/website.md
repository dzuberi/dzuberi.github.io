This website. I haven't spent a ton of time doing web programming, so building this website was a learning experience. I initially forked <a href="https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/">îª„</a>, but I've also been manually editing a lot of the templates and creating my own.

This projects subpage, for example, didn't exist in the original but I adapted it to my preferences. I also built the timeline in /experience to be generated from a .yml file.
