I wrote a variety of Computer Architecture simulators that took instruction/memory traces as inputs in my graduate Computer Architecture class. The metrics used for grading were performance and functionality.

Simulators included: Single core L1 cache, Out-of-order execution, Multi-core cache coherence, and Prime and probe attacks. Required use of C/C++ features such as dynamic memory allocation, classes, pointers.
