* [AES implementation in CUDA](https://github.com/dzuberi/AES-Cuda){:target="_blank"}
    * Implemented the AES encryption/decryption algorithm in C++ and CUDA.
    * Implemented a simple windows GUI to choose a file, encryption type and key, and number of threads
    * Verified functionality in encryption/decrpytion in ability to recover the file. Saw significant speedup on my GTX 1080.
