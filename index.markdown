# Welcome!

My name is Danial Zuberi and I am a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at UC San Diego. I am currently in the rotation program so I do not have a set advisor at this time. My research interests lie in the areas of Computer Architecture and Computer Systems.

<!-- So far, I have worked with Dean Tullsen for my first quarter. I mostly have experience in computer architecture and systems, but am excited about most areas of CS. -->
