* **01/2024 - 03/2024: Research Assistant: Amy Ousterhout**
* **09/2023 - 12/2023: Research Assistant: Dean Tullsen**
* **08/2021 - 09/2023: NVIDIA: Senior ASIC Design Verification Engineer**
    * **GPU L2 Cache Team**
        * Develop test and testbench code in C++, Perl, and Python, in a verification codebase for GPU cache IP.
        * Own and build C++ model for cache coherency protocol with thousands of lines of object-oriented code and many stakeholders which regularly identifies bugs in L2 RTL and architectural model implementations.
        * Meet and correspond with RTL designers and GPU architects to understand features and interfaces and to discuss implementation bugs.
* **01/2020 - 08/2021: AMD: Silicon Design Engineer 2**
    * **CPU Cores Team - Decode Unit**
        * Built on a specialized C++ testbench to verify complex x86 CISC decode unit for high performance multiprocessors.
        * Developed and owned verification code for Immediate, Data, and RIP interface that covered entire x86 instruction space, as well as touching on code for multiple other features.
        * Wrote and understood x86 instructions/testcases for debug and debugged by analyzing waveforms in a massive RTL codebase.
* **01/2020 - 08/2021: Texas Instruments: Design Engineer 2**
    * **FPD-Link Team**
        * Wrote code in object-oriented multi-threaded SystemVerilog verification environment in tandem with design updates for new features, identifying and locating RTL bugs and logic errors in the design or testbench, running regressions, for SerDes chipset.
        * Verified various standard communications protocols such as I2C, SPI, CSI-2(D/C-PHY) at a low level.
* **01/2019 - 05/2019**
    * **Georgia Tech: Graduate TA, Analog Electronics Lab**
        * Led students through a series of weekly laboratory experiments & graded assignments.
* **08/2018 - 12/2018:**
    * **Georgia Tech: Graduate TA, High Performance Computer Architecture**
        * held office hours to help students learn concepts, answered online questions to assist graduate students with course concepts and projects in the form of large-scale C++ simulations, and graded exams.
* **08/2018 - 12/2018:**
    * **Georgia Tech: Research for Credit, Application Aware Computing Lab**
        * Worked with a graduate student to run reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) experiments to train a CPU in a robot to tune parameters such as frequency as it traversed a maze using A*.
* **05/2017 - 08/2017:**
    * **Caterpillar: Engineering Intern, Autonomy & Sites**
        * Developed on NVIDIA Jetson TX2, creating ROS packages in C++ to interface sensors and cameras, while also developing microcon-troller code in C & C++ using common protocols like I2C and Serial to collect data to classify concrete with Machine Learning.
* **08/2016 - 12/2016:**
    * **Georgia Tech - Research for Credit, Low Frequency Radio Group**
        * Used MATLAB to analyze and visualize data in attempt to find precursors to earthquakes in sub-ionospheric VLF signals.
* **01/2016 - 04/2016**:
    * **GE Transportation: Engineering Intern**
